      <p>
        All cats - from small, fluffy balls to adults to feline seniors - are
        free spirits. Individualists on four legs who know best what they want
        and what they need in life. However, no matter how independent or
        self-sufficient they try to be - cats need someone to look after them
        and take care of them. We are happy that Foodschmood can look after them
        at every stage of your life.
